"Last login: June 13, 2007 5:30 PM PDT". "Account created on: January 6, 2006 8:04 PM PST". I haven't used my WoW account in such a long time I had forgotten how much I used to love it. But sadly all things come to an end (and with the release of Tabula Rasa and the purchase of a better gaming rig on the way...). Who am I kidding? I'll get the new rig and TR for sure. But I'll only play it 1/4 as much as I used to play WoW. If that.<!--more--><span></span>

I'm canceling my WoW account as I type this and I can't help but feel a twinge of nostalgia and maybe a little guilt. I missed all the days of running raids until 4am, bitching about guild-mates on ventrillo, trying to make 300 gold in a day on the auction houses. This life just isn't for me (and hasn't been for about 4 months now). I have to move on. To expand myself as an adult gamer and as a professional (showing up for work is a plus you know).

So it is with great pain that I announce the passing of Phaelanx, Phaetank, Phaesneak and Phaelock of Maiev and Phaelanx of Arathor (formerly Moonrunner).
