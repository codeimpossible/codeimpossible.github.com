Where was I when <a href="http://www.y2k38.info/" target="_blank">this was written</a>??? Oh, right. I was a finishing my Sophomore year in High School. Oh well. Any way, apparently the Unix operating system (and I would think any 32-bit operating system) will fail in the year 2038. Well, January 19, 2038 3:14:08 UTC to be precise. <!--more-->"Why?" You ask? Well Unix calculates time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 12:00:00. Each second is represented as an integer and the maximum value for a 32-bit integer is 2,147,483,647 which, when translated to seconds, equals 1/19/2038 3:14:07.

The author of the article above believes that 1 of two things will happen as a result of the failure. The software will either crash horribly or will simply roll back the date to 1/1/1970 at midnight. There isn't really a whole lot to worry about here though as by the year 2030 most operating systems will be  in 64-bit land and probably even in 128-bit where the problem will be set to re-occur only 290 billion years in the future plus or minus a billion. The article is a pretty interesting read and will satisfy the geek in you for a little while.
