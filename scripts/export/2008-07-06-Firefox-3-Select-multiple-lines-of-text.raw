# Firefox 3: Select multiple lines of text
## 

I never knew this but Firefox 3 has a new feature that allows you to select multiple lines of text. Just use the ctrl key (cmd on Macs) while selecting text as you normally would.

If you find it isn't working check that you have firebug disabled as it is known to interfere with this feature.

Enjoy!
