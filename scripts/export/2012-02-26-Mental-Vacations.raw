# Mental Vacations
## I came up against some - seemingly - insurmountable problems the other day. So I left work and played video games.

<p>
	I was working on a problem and things weren&#39;t going my way. Tests that <em>should</em>&nbsp;be passing weren&#39;t, errors that didn&#39;t seem possible were popping up and in just about every way imagineable shit was falling apart.</p>
<p>
	I remember thinking &quot;<em>I can do this. If I can just solve this next problem I&#39;ll be in a better spot.</em>&quot; and sometimes this works. I amp myself up, I actually do fix the problem and can go back to being productive. Not this time. These problems seemed too big. I couldn&#39;t focus because everything I had tried had failed. Twice.</p>
<p>
	So I left.</p>
<p>
	That&#39;s right. You heard me. It was 3pm and I stood up from my chair at work, grabbed my coat, drove home and played Star Wars: The Old Republic for the rest of the night. I didn&#39;t startup my work laptop. I didn&#39;t check emails. I disconnected and let my brain relax.</p>
<p>
	Your brain is a muscle and when you&#39;re working on mental problems all day it can get worn out and tired just like your legs, biceps, or any other muscle in your body. Your brain needs a vacation.</p>
<p>
	When that happens you need to disconnect - completely - and go do something that doesn&#39;t involve thinking. I play video games but you could easily play music, go for a jog, go fishing, hiking, whatever. The point is to get your brain the time it needs to recoup so you can come back the next day and attack the problem(s) head on.</p>
<p>
	I got up the next morning, drove into work, and when I sat down at my desk within 5 minutes I had noticed three things that I was doing <strong>that were completely and utterly wrong</strong>. Also, they were really stupid mistakes, a sign that my brain had just given up. I fixed them and things started working, builds are passing, tests are running and I&#39;m back to being productive.</p>
<p>
	But I would have sat at work for the rest of the day and never realized my errors unless I had that time to reboot.</p>
<p>
	Don&#39;t be afraid to realize that you&#39;re not making any progress and take a mental vacation and come back into the office swinging. You&#39;ll find that those problems that seemed so insurmountable yesterday are probably childs play after your mental vacation.</p>
