# Wordpress 2.5 released!

I am so excited about this release of wordpress. Whats new? load-time improvements, built-in Gravatar and gallery support (YES!!!), built-in plugin upgrade feature oh, yeah and the entirely new admin interface and customizable dashboard screen. What am I most excited about? Well aside from the already mentioned bitchin' admin interface I'm really excited about the code improvements (more detailed comments and database optimizations FTW).

When can wp.com users (like yours truly) expect some 2.5 action? Within the next week or so you should see the new interface in your admin consoles.
