# Interview questions that don't suck - jQuery
## Continuing the series of interview questions that don't suck, this time focusing on a nice jQuery/HTML question.

<p>
	Continuing on in the &quot;Interview Questions That Don&#39;t Suck&quot; series, this time I wanted to highlight a nice jQuery/HTML question that I&#39;ve used in the past.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The following code binds an event to every <code>&lt;a /&gt;</code> tags click event. How many problems can you spot in the code below. What are they? Why are they problems?</strong></p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;script type="text/html"&gt;
 $('a').each(function() {
   $(this).click(function(e) {
     alert('clicked!');
   });
 });
 &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>How did you do? Post your answers in the comments!</p>
