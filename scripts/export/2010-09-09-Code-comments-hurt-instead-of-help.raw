# Code comments hurt instead of help
## 

Remember when I said "<a href="http://codeimpossible.com/2010/07/16/comments-stink/">Iâ€™ve never seen a block of code that actually needed a comment. Ever.</a>"? 

Here's a great example of what I'm talking about:

<a href="http://codeimpossible.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/comments_are_useless.png"><img src="http://codeimpossible.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/comments_are_useless.png" alt="" title="comments_are_useless" width="599" height="218" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947" /></a>

There isn't one comment in there that adds value to this code. In fact there are two that <strong>are completely and utterly incorrect</strong> about what this code does.
