# Notepad++, it's time we saw other editors
## Notepad++ is an awesome text editor but it's become a bit of a frustration point lately, so I'm trying out a new editor: SublimeText

<p>
	Notepad++ has been my text editor of choice for the past 6 years. I&#39;ve always found it to be a productivity aide and it&#39;s always&nbsp;<strong>just worked</strong>. However, lately, Notepad++ has a nasty habit of losing all of my settings and it&#39;s becoming unbearable.</p>
<p>
	I asked on twitter the other day if anyone had a better editor that they had used on Windows. I got a lot of good suggestions and most of them were for <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>.</p>
<p>
	First things first: you should be aware that SublimeText is not free. It has an unlimited time trial but you&#39;ll get a semi-annoying popup asking you to buy a copy. Currently, SublimeText costs $59 per user.</p>
<p>
	The good news is that SublimeText is licensed on a per-user basis, not per-machine. This means you can install your licensed copy of SublimeText on as many machines as you like. Also, SublimeText uses a hosted version of Python v2.6.5, so you can build some pretty awesome plugins. I&#39;ll have a post soon on how to build a pretty sweet plugin in a few days.</p>
<p>
	SublimeText has an awesome set of features. I&#39;ve pointed out a few of my favorites in the screenshot below but there are others that deserve a mention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
	<strong>Totally Configurable and Extendable</strong><br />
	All of the user/global settings are stored in editable JSON files. Need to add a custom keybinding? No problem. Select Preferences\Key Bindings - Default or Key Bindings - User and start editing. All key bindings call python-based plugin methods so adding a keybinding for your plugin is really simple.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Auto Completion</strong><br />
	SublimeText has a really great tab autocompletion system. It auto-completes local variables, local methods and it seems to have an uncanny knowledge of what you meant.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Finding stuff is easier</strong><br />
	The find function is incredibly easy to use, just hit ctrl+f and start typing. SublimeText will bring you to the first match and start highlighing all the other matches.&nbsp;Find and replace uses&nbsp;<strong>real</strong> regular expressions, not the strange hybrid that notepad++ uses and definitely not that filthy mess that visual studio tries to pass off as regular expressions.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ll be evaluating SublimeText for another couple of days, building out some plugins and using it as my default for a while before I make the decision to buy it, but it&#39;s already impressed the hell out of me and made me want to stop using Notepad++.</p>
