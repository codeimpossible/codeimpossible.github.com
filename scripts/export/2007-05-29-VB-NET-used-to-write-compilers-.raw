# VB.NET used to write compilers?
## 

It's apparently <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2007/05/24/20730.aspx" target="_blank">true</a>. Silverlight's JavaScript compiler will be written entirely in Visual Basic .NET. Also of note: the Visual Basic 10 (ORCAS release) compiler is being written in Visual Basic .NET as well.

All I have to say is:

Why is this such a big deal?<!--more-->

With the advent of the .NET CLR developing an application in C++, VB, or C# is simply a syntax preference. The code still gets sent to the CLR and converted into a common machine language. That is the beauty of .NET. One team can code a piece of an enterprise system in VB and another team working soley in C# can use it without any change to the application.

So when people start screaming "Oh my god they used VB??!?!" just look at them and say:

No, they just liked it's syntax.
