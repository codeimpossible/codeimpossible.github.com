# W.O.M.M. weekly post #2
## 

<img class="alignleft" title="works-on-my-machine-starburst" src="http://wpup.codeimpossible.com/2009/06/works-on-my-machine-starburst.jpg" alt="works-on-my-machine-starburst" />Due to me being insanely sick this week I'm going to be changing up the format for the Works On My Machine weekly project post for this week.

Instead of presenting a project that I've worked on I'd like to highlight some .Net OSS projects / source code that I've been working with / looking at lately.

Â 
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/morelinq/" target="_blank">The More Linq project</a> - An extension library for LinqToObjects run by Jon Skeet.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.musikcube.com/" target="_blank">MusikCube</a> - Awesome music player that uses SqlLite to allow "smart playlists" (eg. show me all songs that were added this week that have fewer than 4 stars and have been played less than 10 times).</li>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/" target="_blank">Moq</a> - IMHO the best mocking framework for .net development.</li>
	<li>Scott Hanselman posted some code on his website a while back about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheWeeklySourceCode35ZipCompressingASPNETSessionAndCacheState.aspx" target="_blank">how to Zip Compress your Session and Cache data</a> in Asp.net.</li>
</ul>
Feel free to send me any code that you come across and I'll feature it in a future post.
