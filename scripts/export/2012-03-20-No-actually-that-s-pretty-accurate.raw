# No, actually that's pretty accurate
## Was talking about Rails with some friends. 

<p>
	Me: it is fast enough when it&#39;s loaded up</p>
<p>
	Me: it&#39;s startup that takes a while</p>
<p>
	John: like an asp.net website project, eh?</p>
<p>
	Me: yeah</p>
<p>
	Me: but</p>
<p>
	Me: like</p>
<p>
	Me: no</p>
<p>
	Me: actually that&#39;s pretty accurate</p>
