# Useful Code: Object.isArray()
##

When you need to find out the type of an object in JavaScript you would just do the following:

<pre>
var x = 1;
alert(typeof x);
</pre>

Well what if x were an array? With x as an array a typeof incorrectly returns "object" as the type. Well that is just plain wrong. Enter the isArray() method.

<pre>
Object.isArray =  function(o) {
    return o &amp;&amp; o.constructor === Array;
};
</pre>

Granted it's not as simple as typeof but it does correctly identify array objects and is something every JavaScript developer should have in their <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GarageSalesAndGarageSaleQualityCode.aspx" target="_blank">code garage</a>.
