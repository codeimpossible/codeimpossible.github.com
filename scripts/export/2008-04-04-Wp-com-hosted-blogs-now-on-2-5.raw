# Wp.com hosted blogs now on 2.5
## 

What a great way to end the week. I logged in to my dashboard tonight to prep a post for tomorrow and found that my hosted wp.com blog has now been upgraded to WordPress 2.5. Excellent! Right now I am really digging the new look of the admin section (full-screen editing ftw!) and I can't wait to see how the blog performs with the new performance enhancements.

Expect a lot more posts about WP 2.5 over the next couple of days.
