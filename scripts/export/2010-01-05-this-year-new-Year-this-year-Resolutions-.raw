# this.year = new Year(); this.year.Resolutions =
## 

I've spent the last few days going over what I want to accomplish this year, what I think I definitely could do, what might challenge me and what is just this side of impossible. Whenever I've made my resolutions known in the past its always been in a passing conversation with a friend of family member. I never wrote them down or tried to keep track of them once the conversation was over so this year I decided to post them publicly to give me that extra bit of motivation, and also I'll be able to check back here throughout the year and see how I'm measuring up.

These are in no particular order.

<strong>I need to grow more as a professional.</strong> Last year I went to my first conference (MSDEVCON) and it was a total blast. I met a lot of truly awesome and intelligent people and learned a billion things that I didn't know before. After that I attended Stack Overflows Dev Days in Boston and it was the same experience all over again. This year My goal is to start attending more conferences/events (as many as I can afford with time and $$$) to grow myself as a professional.

<strong>Make more mistakes. </strong>I made my fair share of mistakes in 2009 and (more importantly) I learned a lot from them: about myself, my skills, and what I am capable of. I'm addicted. I'm going to put myself more out in the open and make some more mistakes so I can learn a lot more in 2010.

<strong>I need to lose at least 25lbs this year.</strong> I've let myself go over the past few years and it's time to take my health more seriously. 25lbs probably doesn't sound like a lot and honestly it's a lot less than I need to lose but I've never been good at staying fit so hopefully I achieve this goal relatively early and am able to keep the weight off the rest of the year.

<strong>No more sugary drinks, especially soda.</strong> I'm looking at you Mt. Dew. I'm not sure what happened but between the end of the year work rush and the holiday (fr)antics I've been downing soda like it's going out of style. Time for that to end.

<strong>Eliminate debt.</strong> This goal is a bit lofty but my goal is to eliminate 80% of all my debts this year. This is going to be a tough one to pull off, what with the recent job change and our new house but it's needed.

<strong>Finish </strong><em><strong>something</strong></em><strong>. </strong>I started <a href="http://code.google.com/p/myrkat" target="_blank">way</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsoq" target="_blank">too</a> <a href="http://codeimpossible.com/jsoq" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="http://whatdidijusteat.com" target="_blank">side</a> projects last year, and I finished... none. Not one project I started in 2009 saw what I would call a 1.0 release. Time to crap or get off the pot. I aim to crap. My goal will be to promote at least 2 of the projects I started in 2009 to a 1.0 release this year.

<strong>More play.</strong> Tamara and I didn't get a vacation last year and we are dying for some time away. This is going to be tough with all my debt elimination going on but the more debt I get rid of the more I can save.

<strong>More sleep.</strong> Tamara reminds me all the time how little sleep I get ( about 4-5 hours a night at most ) and it really started to show during the holidays. I simply ran myself into the ground. Time to recharge and see what I can really do.
