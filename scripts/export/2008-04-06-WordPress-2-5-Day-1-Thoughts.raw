# WordPress 2.5 Day 1 Thoughts
## 

I've been really excited about WordPress 2.5 being released and was really depressed when I left my web host because I didn't think they would be upgrading anytime soon. I was really wrong. About a week after it was released to the public WP 2.5 was installed on all hosted WP.com accounts and I've been a happier blogger ever since.

I'm not going to talk a lot about the new look as I think others have covered it enough and most of us are of the same opinion: it rocks. Instead I'd like to talk about the changes that I am most excited about.
<h3><strong>Galleries</strong></h3>
I've set up photo galleries on many platforms, PhpNuke, Nucleus CMS, WP, Greymatter and MovableType to name a few. Out of all of those, I had the least trouble with wordpress. However I still had to download a plugin that wasn't supported by wordpress and I wasn't sure if it would be around after six months.

The gallery function in WP 2.5 is excellent. My only gripe is that it seems to take a while for my uploaded pictures to show up in the gallery tab but I assume this is just due to excessive load on the server.
<h3>Writing</h3>
The new editor is excellent. I am very happy with the full-screen mode. It allows me to focus on what I am typing which makes editing and reviewing that much easier. When not in fullscreen mode the UI of the writing page is just like the rest of wordpress. It just feels right.
<h3>Speed</h3>
Wordpress 2.5 <em>feels</em> faster. I'd have to have my old 2.3.3 version of WP back to do a comparison (please no!) but 2.5 just feels faster to me. All the pages respond snappily and posting doesn't take as long as it used to.

The WP team has definitely set the bar for all other blog platforms and they've set it pretty damn high. <a title="Katz Web Design Review of WordPress 2.5" href="http://katzwebdesign.wordpress.com/2008/04/04/wordpress-dot-com-finally-updates-to-2-point-5-a-review/" target="_blank">Katz Web Design</a> asked "<em>who would want to use Blogger.com?</em>" and I think that is the perfect question. After experiencing WP 2.5 who would use any other blog software? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?
