# Lessons Learned
## 

lessons learned this morning: 
a) Even if it's simple code you "know" will work you <strong>must</strong> test it. No excuses. 
b) In programming, nothing happens by "magic". There is a tangible reason that that thing that should be working isn't.
c) Don't assume something couldn't be true simply because it doesn't make any sense.
