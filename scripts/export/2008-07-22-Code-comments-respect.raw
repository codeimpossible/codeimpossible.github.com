# Code comments = respect
## 

<p>
	I was browsing around Code Project the other day, I subscribe to their most recent submissions feed to watch for interesting samples, and I saw a unique take on a logging system.</p>
<p>
	It used IL replacement, much like TypeMock Isolator, to allow developers to enable/disable the logger without having to compile any code. In theory, I haven&#39;t tried it out yet, you would be able to add this logging system to any project without coding anything. I downloaded the code and it&#39;s huge.</p>
<p>
	5 assemblies, over 2000 lines and there is some COM stuff in there. I notice two things. First it&#39;s all in c++. This is not a bad thing it&#39;s just not my first language. So I start looking around for some comments to let me know what the heck is going on in this code. Annnnnnd... hmmmm thats odd.</p>
<p>
	There are <strong>no</strong> comments. Not one. I checked the author notes on the original submission article to see if this was an error and there was an updated link. Nope. Nothing. It takes me a minute but near the bottom of the post I see why there are no comments. The author writes:</p>
<blockquote>
	&quot;I like to think I write self-documenting code so I tend to not have any comments in my code.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>
	I instantly deleted the code from my system. My thought is if the author of this code didn&#39;t think it was worthy of some kind of explanation then I am certainly not going to waste my time with it. Comments aren&#39;t just some &quot;nice to have&quot; thing.</p>
<p>
	They show that you actually care about what you are putting out there and they show your thought process throughout the codes execution. If you don&#39;t care about that then why would I? I&#39;m not saying that every line, function call and variable needs a comment but any programmer worth his salt should put some form of documentation into his/her code. It&#39;s a sign of respect.</p>
<p>
	So my fellow developers let&#39;s respect each other enough to document what we put out into the world. What do you say?</p>
