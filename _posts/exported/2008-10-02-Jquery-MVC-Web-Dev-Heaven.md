# Jquery + MVC = Web Dev Heaven
## 

So <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/jQueryToShipWithASPNETMVCAndVisualStudio.aspx" target="_blank">Jquery is going to become part of Asp.net MVC</a>. First off, congrats to <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">the Jquery team</a>. They've put out a really awesome product. Second, congrats to Microsoft for catching every .Net developer completely by surprise, proving, again, that they are listening to the community.

I never really got into the microsoft javascript libraries that shipped with the ajax control toolkit because I found that I could do things much faster using external javascript libraries .

It will be interesting to see what Microsoft contributes back to the Jquery community in later updates to the ASP MVC product.
