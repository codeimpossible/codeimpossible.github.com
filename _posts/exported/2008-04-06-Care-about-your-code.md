# Care about your code
## 

<a title="Jeff Perrins blog" href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/jeff_perrin/default.aspx" target="_blank">Jeff Perrin</a> posted <a title="Self Concious Development" href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/jeff_perrin/archive/2008/04/04/self-conscious-development.aspx" target="_blank">a great one-liner</a> today:
<blockquote>Write code as if you care what others think about what youâ€™ve written.</blockquote>
I couldn't agree with this sentiment more. I do this at work all the time. I worry about what my peers will think when they look at the code I'm writing. And you know what? It really helps me to take extra steps to ensure that the code I write is code that I wouldn't worry about handing off to a fellow co-worker.

I think all developers should take Jeff's advice and embrace self conscious development.
