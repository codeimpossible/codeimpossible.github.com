Okay, every gamer is right now is saying "What the $*^% is Streambase, and why do I care???". Well I'll tell you. Streambase is a provider of Complex Event Processing solutions for high-end, high-speed, real-time business needs. Hmmm still not getting through eh? Okay try this on for size.<!--more-->

Streambase provides data monitoring systems that are designed to  monitor, track and respond to large amounts of data in real-time. Why is this important to BioWare and their new MMO? BioWare will be using Streambase to accomplish what I can only call the most ambitious undertaking in MMO history. BioWare states that they will be able to monitor server performance and issue fixes in real-time during game-play without the need for server down-time.

Let me say that again. A Star Wars MMO; that won't suck rancor nards like galaxies; that will allegedly be online 24/7 (unlike galaxies); did I mention it won't suck?
