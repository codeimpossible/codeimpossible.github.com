# iTunes doesn&#039;t grok &quot;synching&quot;
## 

I got an iPod Touch few weeks ago and I have to say that I am really happy with it. It has some hangups, like <em>how come I can't use it's WiFi connection to download new podcasts</em>, or <em>why can't I save a mp3 file locally from it's safari browser</em>, but for the most part it is a great piece of tech. The 2.0 firmware added a lot more worth with the App Store applications.

However iTunes is still less than stellar. iTunes is like being chaperoned on your first date. If you want to hang out with the iPod, iTunes is going to tag along.

iTunes' slow, ugly, and cluttered UI hasn't changed since the last time I used it ( version 6 dot something) and although finding and downloading podcasts has improved, how iTunes synchronizes to the iPod has not.

When I connect my iPod to my pc iTunes loads and begins synchronizing my data. However, if I download new content iTunes ignores it and does not synch it.

Even if I have specified that all types of that content are to be synched I will have to manually trigger iTunes to synchronize.

This is very bad from an end-user perspective. All developers writing software that synchronizes to/from an external datasource listen up: a user should not have to tell the software when to synch.

A user should be given the option to manually synch or to completely disable auto-synching but by default the system should synch new content "automagically".

Don't make end-users tell your software it's ok to do what it is supposed to do because we don't want the hassle.
