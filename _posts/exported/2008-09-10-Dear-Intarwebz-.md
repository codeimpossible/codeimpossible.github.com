<a title="just. another. browser." href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">It's called "Chrome"</a>. It happens to be made by Google. It's <strong>just. another. browser.</strong> Are we done? Can we move on as a society?

EDIT: ok, so Chrome is fast. Really fast. I loaded <a href="http://nerget.com/rayjs/rayjs.html" target="_blank">Oliver Hunt's JavaScript Ray Tracer</a> in FireFox 3.0.3 and it took 30.393 seconds to complete a render. Under Chrome the render took less than 6.5 seconds.
