# Palindrome Batch
## 

This was originally <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/52002/how-to-check-if-the-given-string-is-palindrome#52031" target="_blank">posted by Pam over on StackOverflow</a> but I thought it was too awesome and had to share it, just in case you want validate a palindrome from the command line one day.

EDIT: I removed the code and provided a link to the comment at StackOverflow. You can check out Pams' blog here: <a href="http://pm-db.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://pm-db.blogspot.com/</a>
