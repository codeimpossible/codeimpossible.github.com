# Blogging: the destupidifier
## 

<blockquote>The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything - William Connor Magee</blockquote>
More often than not I decide to not post something here because I worry about looking stupid. Fact is, I am stupid (and I write <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000099.html" target="_blank">shitty code with bugs</a> :D ) but I've found that blogging helps me think things out.

Which is why I've started a blog with my Sister and older brother over at <a title="The Family Blog" href="http://barbozabloggers.com" target="_blank">BarbozaBloggers.com</a>. Don't worry I'm not leaving Pistalwhipped! behind I'm just thinking through different topics and decided that another blog would be a better venue.

Blogging over at BB will also allow me to eliminate a lot of the bloggers block that I encounter with this blog.

What I'm hoping is to have one site stimulate discussion for the other allowing both to grow by feeding off of each others content.

We'll see how it turns out eh?Â  Oh, also: I get to hang out with my family which is a huge bonus.

EDIT: i realized the other day that I forgot to include the link to Jeff Atwoods post. I've updated the post to include it as it took on a whole different tone without it. :D
