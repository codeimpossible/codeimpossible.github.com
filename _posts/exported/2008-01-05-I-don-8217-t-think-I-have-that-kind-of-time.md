So I got my new Dell PC late friday night and it is awesome. Vista is not the greatest operating system and I would much rather have XP pro or Media Center 2k5 on here but it works and it works <strong>fast</strong>. The dual-core 5ghz really shows on this thing. Except, apparently when I'm transferring files from my older PC to the new one. I have about 9gb of photos on my old pc that I am still in the process of moving over and judging from the screen shot above, I'll be in the process of moving over for a long time.
