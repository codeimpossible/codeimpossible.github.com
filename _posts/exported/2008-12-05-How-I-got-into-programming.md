# How I got into programming
## 

I know exactly why I got into programming. I'm not so sure when it happened but I do know why.

I was always obsessed with understanding how things worked. I <strong>had</strong> to know. Everything had to be taken apart and then put back together, whenever my dad or mom would throw out some piece of computer hardware or other machinery I would ask to see it before they did.

Then I would retreat to my room and take whatever it was apart and see how it did what it did. Even if I didn't really understand what was going on with whatever I was taking apart in the end it was still fun and exciting. Transformers were, of course, my favorite toys.

I think it was late 1995 / early 1996 when my dad bought me a copy of Visual Basic 4.0 at one of our local computer shows. I remember being really excited because I would finally figure out how programs like WordPerfect, xTree, Windows, and Commander Keen really worked.

Unfortunately my copy of Visual Basic never really showed me how Windows or Commander Keen worked but it kept me occupied for that whole summer and opened me up to a whole world of new things to figure out.

I know exactly why I got into programming. I'm not so sure when it happened but at least I know why.
