# Podcasts
## A friend asked me the other day if I could recommend some podcasts for him to listen to. 

<p>
	I&#39;ve been meaning to post this for about a year now, and I&#39;m not sure why it took me so long. I get asked what podcasts I listen to by my developer friends a lot. I always try to throw a few out there but I can never remember the whole list - which is actually kind of sad because the list isn&#39;t that long.</p>
<p>
	Most of these podcasts are around the 1 hour mark for time, except Hanselminutes which is usually about 40 minutes.</p>
<p>
	So without further delay, here is the list of podcasts that I enjoy!</p>
<p>
	<em>One last delay: My pal, <a href="http://johnnycode.com">John Bubriski</a> has a great list of podcasts (and many other things) over on his <a href="http://www.johnnycode.com/blog/resources/">Developer Resources</a> page.</em></p>
<p>
	<em>One more one last delay - I&#39;ve marked podcasts that have strong language with a NSFW.</em></p>
