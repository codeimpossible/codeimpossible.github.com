This recipe serves 2 people and is an excellent Sunday morning breakfast treat.

Ingredients:
<ul>
	<li>2 Red Peppers</li>
	<li>1/2 Yellow Pepper (Roughly Chopped)</li>
	<li>1/2 Orange Pepper (Roughly Chopped)</li>
	<li>1 Ham Steak (1/4")</li>
	<li>2 Eggs</li>
	<li>1/4 Onion (Roughly Chopped)</li>
	<li>6 Asparagus Stalks (cut into small bite-sized pieces)</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
	<li>1/2 cup sliced Asiago cheese</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
</ul>
Begin by cooking the ham steak over low-medium heat. You will want to brown it on both sides (5-6 minutes on each side). Saut√© the asparagus, onion, yellow and orange peppers in heated olive oil along with the salt and pepper for 5-7 minutes. The asparagus should still be crisp.

Remove the tops and centers of the red peppers taking care not to pierce or damage the sides of them. These will serve as your bowls for the dish.

At this point it is safe to start the eggs. I scrambled mine with a little butter and salt but you may want to use a sunny-side-up presentation which will work well too. Check the ham and after it has browned on both sides remove it from the heat and begin cubing it.

When the eggs are just about done it will be time to start plating. You will start by layering the ingredients in the following order (bottom to top) in each red pepper: Vegetables, Ham, Asiago cheese and finally the eggs. Garnish with a sprig of thyme and you are all set. Enjoy!
