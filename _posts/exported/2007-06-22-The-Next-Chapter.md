# The Next Chapter
## 

<p>
	I will be leaving my current position as a Software Engineer for Cyphermint Inc (<a href="http://www.cyphermint.com" target="_blank">http://www.cyphermint.com</a>) on July 6th after working there for 3 years. I&#39;ll be moving on to a company named ScerIS (<a href="http://www.sceris.com" target="_blank">http://www.sceris.com</a>) to work on some of their very interesting projects.</p>
<p>
	My years at Cyphermint were wonderful. Full of fun, learning and great people. Sure there were some killjoys along the way (and some in the end too) but those types of people are everywhere and shouldn&#39;t compose the whole view of a company. I wish all the best to everyone at Cyphermint.</p>
<p>
	They are on the verge of becoming the next &quot;big thing&quot; in more ways than one. They wouldn&#39;t be in the position they are now (several big releases right around the corner) without the talent and dedication of the employees they have.</p>
<p>
	The time simply came for me to move out on my own and discover what I could truly do on my own. I hope you all understand. It was a privilege to work with such a talented staff.</p>
