# Don&#8217;t get ground up in the rumor mill
## 

Every office has a rumor mill. It's part and parcel of the whole office gig. It's easy to get caught up in the all the drama that is going on at work "Did you hear that Josh and Tina are an item now?", "I heard we are all going to be working for Herbert next week!", etc. We are all gossipers. Even those that seem impervious to the gossip will eventually find themselves caught up in it if they are not careful.<!--more-->

First off, just because rumors and gossip are generally more closely associated with women don't let this fool you. Men are just as guilty of gossip and in my own experiences just as bad or worse at getting caught up in the rumors flying around. Some people are more easily caught up when they hear something from Jon than if they had heard the same thing from Samantha. Don't let this fool you. When it comes to rumors trust no one.

The rumor mill has no age limit. People of any age can get wrapped up in the rumor mill. Don't trust the more experienced ad executive simply because he is older. That doesn't mean he has more experience than anyone else with the rumor mill.

When you hear a rumor take it with a grain of salt. Remember that game you played in kindergarten where all the kids sat in a circle and one child whispered a phrase to their neighbor and that child whispered what they heard to their neighbor and so on and so on? Remember how the result was completely different than the phrase at the beginning? Well the rumor mill is simply this principle put into practice on a larger (or smaller) scale.

Don't react. When someone presents you with a rumor that is particularly inflammatory resist the urge to  react in the moment. Take a breath, dismiss yourself from the conversation, go for a walk, get some water or coffee do anything but react. If your team is going to be transferred to Herberts' reign then it is going to happen. There is nothing you can do about it now the best thing that can be done is to try to establish a working relationship with Herbert or polish your resume.

It's easy to get caught up in the rumor mill but it is not impossible to avoid. Remember to take all rumors with a grain of salt, and to never react to a rumor in the moment and you will discover you have what it takes to survive the office rumor mill.
