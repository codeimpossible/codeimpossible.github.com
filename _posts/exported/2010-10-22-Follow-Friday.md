# Follow Friday
## Twitter is great for keeping up with what your neighbors cat is up to, but it's also a great resource for keeping up with other developers. Following some advice from a co-worker I've put together a small list of devs that I follow that I think you should follow too.

One of my co-workers, @chrisbloom7, <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisbloom7/status/22262783746">offered some advice recently on how people should handle #followfridays</a> on twitter. 

<blockquote>#protip: Don't just spew a list of names on #FF. Use a whole tweet to tell me WHY I should follow each twitterer.</blockquote>

Which is an awesome idea, but I hate the fact that my tweets will <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/10_ways_to_archive_your_tweets.php">eventually disappear</a> or get lost amidst floods of tweets in other twitterers feeds so I've posted a few developers that I would recommend other follow on twitter.

<a href="http://twitter.com/chrisbloom7">@chrisbloom7</a> - Smart and witty web developer. A fellow TDD and ruby enthusiast, co-worker at Wake}fly, open source developer, mac hobbyist. Keep on truffle shuffle'n.

<a href="http://twitter.com/johnbubriski">@johnbubriski</a> - Calm, cool and collected .net developer and another of the Wake}fly twitteristas. He's talked me down off the architecture astronaut ledge more times than I can count. You should also <a href="http://www.johnnycode.com/blog/">check out his blog</a>.

<a href="http://twitter.com/digitalbush">@digitalbush</a> - Developer who talented and driven to finding the best solution to a problem, not just the fastest. Author of the <a href="http://digitalbush.com/projects/hotlinkr">hotlinkr</a> project as well as <a href="http://digitalbush.com/projects/">several popular jQuery plugins</a>. <a href="http://digitalbush.com/">Check out his blog as well</a>.

<a href="http://twitter.com/edgesmash">@edgesmash</a> - C# developer that is smart, creative and very insightful. He has <a href="http://productiveonceaday.blogspot.com/">an excellent blog that you should read</a>.

<a href="http://twitter.com/Kevin_McManus">@Kevin_McManus</a> - Student at WPI for Computer Game Development (video game companies take notice), co-worker at Wake}fly, smart and eager to learn. Not afraid to be outside his comfort zone. Kevin also has <a href="http://www.rustedmushroom.com/">a blog that is very much worth checking out</a>.

As far as I'm concerned, having a list of recommended follows on twitter is just as important as having a recommended reading list or recommended blog/feed reading list.

So, thats my list, who would you recommend to a another developer?
