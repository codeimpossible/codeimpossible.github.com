I don't think I'm going to write up a 2014 reflection post. I didn't set any goals, so there was nothing to measure, but I ended the year unhappy with what it _felt_ like I got done.

Because that's all I had. Feelings. I didn't have any data to look at to compare where I was with where _I wanted to be_.

Time to fix that. My wife and I sat down on New Years Eve and shared our resolutions and how we are going to measure success with each one. Sharing it with my wife should be enough to motivate me, but just in case I think it will be best if I write up my goals for 2015 here.

### Be healthier. Lose 50 lbs.
I was *ok* with my weight through the spring and summer of 2014. I tore my shoulder and gave up on my workouts in the fall and completely fell to pieces in the winter. 50lbs in a year seems hard but I want to aim high and push myself here because this is where I need the most improvement. I don't take care of myself at all and it's starting to take its toll on me. I'll be adding regular workouts to my routine, changing how much I eat and _what_ I eat. I want to hit my goal but I also don't want to have a flash-in-the-pan approach to this either. This is something that needs to stick with me, so slow and steady is better than fast and out of control.

### Focus on us.
My wife and I forgot our anniversary last year. And we took a vacation to look at houses/apartments. We were so wrapped up in the day-to-day stuff that we forgot about the really important things: Us. I'd like to have us set aside time before and after special dates for us to relax and just enjoy each other.

### Make one game, every month. Hopefully ship 3 to app stores.
Frag Castle is going slowly and there isn't enough to show for it. Time to put up or shut up. I want to get better at making games and the only way that is going to happen is by _making games_. Making one game each month is a very doable goal - the hardest part I think is coming up with game ideas each month. I'll blog about each game here, and put them up somewhere so they can be played. Shipping 3 games to app stores is a tough goal, but I think I can make it.

### Give 5 talks.
I've mentioned before that [I love speaking](http://codeimpossible.com/2014/11/23/speaking-protips/), especially about code and games. My goal is to give at least 5 talks this year. I'll get as much feedback from the crowd as I can and blog about each presentation here with the hopes that I can improve and give more talks next year. I'd like for 2 of the talks to be at larg-ish conferences but thats optional. I just want to talk and share what I know with people.

### Learn another language.
I know some Spanish, I can ask for things in Russian, I can have a 30 second conversation in Cantonese and French. It's time to nail down a second language for good. I'm leaning towards Cantonese, but may pick Japanese or Mandarin because they are more widely used.

### Write more.
This blog has been a wasteland the past few years; and so my writing has suffered. **A lot**. You probably knew that by now though. I don't have a per-week or per-anything goal for this yet, but even if I can do two posts a month I'll be super happy. The goal here is to find a voice for me and get some writing out here that I can be really proud of.

### Work on being happy.
I was depressed for a large portion of last year. This isn't me saying that I'm going to just not be unhappy this year, thats impossible. I just want to be able to reflect on how lucky I am to have the life I have and be happy with that in those moments where it feels like theres nothing. I have a Wife that I can sing and dance in front of, a warm house, large fuzzy lap cats, best of the best friends, family that loves me, and a truly great job. These are the things I need to focus on and remember.

### Go out more.
At the end of 2015 I took a job at [Hudl](http://get.hudl.com) as a full-time remote worker. This means that whatever outdoor time I had before is now reduced by at least 80%. My wife and I need to make plans to get out of the house more often, even to just drive around with the windows down. We both love taking pictures so my plan is to measure this by going places we haven't been before to do some scenic photography.

So those are the things that I want to improve this year. Do I have a chance? I think so, but only if I really push myself. I'm looking forward to the challenge.
