description: TL;DR I didn't make a game for February but I've got exciting news about a past project!

February has come and gone and unfortunately I don't have a game to show for it. [I learned a lot from my January 1GAM]() and had a blast making it, so you're probably wondering what could make me not complete an entry for this month?

Well, remember "Rock Kickass"? It's an action-platformer that I have been working on for the past year now (off and on, more off than on really) with my friend and Frag Castle Games co-founder [@JohnBubriski]().

Well, we'd put RK on hold the past 7 months, we got burned out and started working on other projects to test some ideas. Some of them worked, a lot of them didn't. But, anyway, at the beginning of February I got the RK itch and decided to test a new art style out.

Why the new style?

The sprites for RK originally were insprired by MegaMan and were 64x64 in size. This meant we could have very detailed characters and some great animations, but it also meant spending a lot of time creating those sheets. It could take me anywhere from 2 days to a week to animate a character completely, or even a whole day just to create a concept.

The newer art style is a lot smaller, 32x32 and the characters are less detailed but more animated. This let's me focus on creating characters who convey personality through their motions, which is going to be a huge part of Rock Kickass. I'm really excited about it and can't wait for you to see this new art style in action.
