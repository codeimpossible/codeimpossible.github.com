- No licenses, [I've written about this before](http://codeimpossible.com/2013/05/23/github-license/) but it's worth mentioning here **yet again**: If you're posting source code online and not including some kind of license then [it can only be used by others for personal use](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148146/open-source-code-with-no-license-can-i-fork-it).

- No Readme
- No Contribution Guidelines
- No "Beginner Issues"
- No Roadmap
- No List of project maintainers
- No build steps, or no working build
- No installation steps
- It's Assholes all the way down
