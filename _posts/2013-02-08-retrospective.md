## A look back on the crazy that was 2012

During our recent snow-storm I spent a while thinking about the last twelve months. 2012 was a very awesome year. No, scratch that. 2012 was a **perfect** year. The best year. A year that I'll remember for the rest of my life.

On the 16th of June, I got married to my girlfriend and counter-part of six years. Our wedding was outdoors, it was sunny, perfect. It was and still is the best day of my life.

It's been almost 8 months of being married and I won't say it's been easy but it's been worth it.

### Castle Frag
Two weeks before the wedding I sent off some paperwork to the Secretary of State in Delaware. The articles of incorporation for Frag Castle Games, a small indie game startup that I co-founded with John Bubriski.

In October I got a dream gig. Co-presenting at Monkeyspace in Boston! I got to present on Micro-ORMs with Mr. Bubriski - yeah, he had a great year too :D. You can view our presentation [here](http://johnnycode.com/MassivelyDapperSimpleData).

John proved that he is - in fact - the freaking man by porting one of our proof-of-concept games from XNA to MonoGame **during the conference** and then he contributed some improved game controller code back to the MonoGame library.

### Rock Kickass
In November, Github announced that they were starting a Game-off. Developers across the globe entered by forking a repo on github and began coding away. John and I - repping Frag Castle Games of course - were one of the entries. We built our game: Rock Kickass in 30 crazy days using HTML5, JavaScript and ImpactJS.

Then the unbelieveable happened. *We actually won*.

Well, we were in the top 5. Third, to be exact.

I remember looking over my co-workers shoulder as he brought up the Github blog post announcing the winners. All I could do was repeat "You've gotta be fucking kidding me" over and over until John called me.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" was all I heard when I answered. We were both so blown away that we honestly didn't know what to do next. It took about a week to decompress after that.

Yeah, 2012 was a beast of a year. I've never worked harder and never achieved more. It will be interesting to see what opportunities present themselves in 2013 and how much I can capitalize on them.
